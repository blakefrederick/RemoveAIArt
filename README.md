This is the quickest solution to the problem I'm having of seeing the same annoying AI generated images over and over again. This Chrome Extension removes all instances of any user marked images, matching based on src and also on perceptual hash - meaning if the image is close enough match visually, it will not be shown.

Helper tool to test the effectiveness of the extension:

<img width="407" alt="before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af09fa32-5b35-4538-8aa4-e0ca64e96534" />&#8199;<img width="397" alt="after" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eccfa6e-170f-4d55-af90-62d1d43df8f8" />
